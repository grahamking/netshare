Serve a single file over the web, quite fast.

Build:

    gcc -Ofast -Wall share.c -o share

Run locally:

    # Serve on localhost:8080 with mime type text/plain
    share test.txt

Run properly:

    share -h my.example.com -p 8000 -m image/png come_back_later.png

    share -h 123.456.7.8 -p 80 -m text/html maintenance.html

    share -h file.example.com -p 8001 -m application/octet-stream backup.tar.gz

Defaults: Host is localhost, port is 8080, mime type is text/plain.

Note that this serves _only a single file_. If you serve HTML, all
your media must be inline (base64 url's, for example).

Files under 5M are served by stashing them in kernel pipes, files above that
use sendfile. Feel free to tweak THRESHOLD - the limiting factor is open files.

Linux only, recent kernel's (2.6.17+).

BUGS:
Will crash if too many concurrent hits.
